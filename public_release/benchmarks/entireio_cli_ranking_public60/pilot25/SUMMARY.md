# entireio_cli_ranking_public60_pilot25

This benchmark compares raw `ripgrep`, fast indexed search, and the final `pgr` tool on a public, trace-derived `entireio/cli` prompt suite.

## Setup

- Tasks: 25
- Repeats per condition: 1
- Conditions: `baseline`, `fff`, `pgr`
- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Max turns: 12
- Repo: `entireio/cli`
- Repo root: `/tmp/pgr-eval/repos/entireio-cli`

## Prompt categories

- `code_understanding`
- `debug_or_validation`
- `implementation`

## Example tasks

- `eb5cdbdef570` (code_understanding): what's wrong with `entire explain`?
- `897eb280e769` (implementation): Can you read docs/architecture/shadow-branch-suffixes.md, I'd like to modify this approach: I don't think we need suffixes but instead we just use one branch, is there overlap in files we continue, if there is no overlap and the new session did create local changes, then we reset the shadow branch to a clean state. Can you ultrathink about it and come up with a new plan?
- `5eec47c03756` (debug_or_validation): The handling of trees via go-git seem to not be working effectively and erroring early, as not all objects are present. This is the current error:
- `61de2c90668f` (debug_or_validation): I think it's better to use `env.InitRepo()` instead of `git.PlainInit()` in tests.
- `37f449ec7d97` (code_understanding): how does auth work for codex with e2e
- `ea384d108347` (code_understanding): What does the nolint:ireturn linter rule refer to?
- `a70d97c363c8` (implementation): Improve the documentation so that it covers the signing of checkpoint commits. For this to work:
- `1d44b085fc12` (implementation): find parts which are talking to the entire API via HTTP - add a global request handler to use the bearer token obtained via the cli login flow
